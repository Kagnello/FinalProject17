# Description
    # This game brings the user through an abandoned house. They will choose a character, then begin their journey with their party.
    # They will travel through rooms in the house, making decisions with each challenge.If the user makes the wrong decision, the game will
    # 'game over', then bring them back to the first choice of direction when the party first enters the house. There is only one path
    # that will lead to the end of the game. If the wrong direction is chosen at the beginning, then the user will be sent back to the
    # entryway after completing challenges, and will choose again until they choose the right path.
    # The goal of the game is to get out of the house.
